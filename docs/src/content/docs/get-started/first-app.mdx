Aspire includes tooling to help you create and configure cloud-native apps. The tooling includes useful starter project templates and other features to streamline getting started with Aspire for Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and CLI workflows. Assuming you have the [prerequisites](./prerequisites) and [Aspire CLI](./installation) installed, you can create a new Aspire solution.

<Steps>

1. Create a new Aspire solution:

    ```bash title="Create a new aspire solution"
    aspire new aspire-starter -n AspireApp -o AspireApp
    ```

    <Aside type='tip' title='Addition CLI option details'>
      The `aspire-starter` template provides several projects, including an API service, web frontend, and app host.
      
      - `-n`: specifies the name of the solution.
      - `-o`: specifies the output directory.
    </Aside>

    If prompted for additional selections, use the <Kbd windows="â†‘" mac="â†‘" /> and <Kbd windows="â†“" mac="â†“" /> keys to navigate the options. 
    Press <Kbd windows="Enter" mac="Return" /> to confirm your selection.

1. Verify the solution was created successfully. The Aspire CLI creates a new folder named _AspireApp_ in the current directory. This folder contains the solution file and several projects, including:

    <FileTree>
    - AspireApp.sln
    - AspireApp.ApiService
        - Properties/
        - appsettings.Development.json
        - appsettings.json
        - AspireApp.ApiService.csproj
        - Program.cs
    - **AspireApp.AppHost** this is your local **dev-time** orchestrator
        - Properties/
        - appsettings.Development.json
        - appsettings.json
        - AspireApp.AppHost.csproj
        - AppHost.cs
    - AspireApp.ServiceDefaults
        - Extensions.cs
        - AspireApp.ServiceDefaults.csproj
    - AspireApp.Web
        - Properties/
        - wwwroot/
        - appsettings.Development.json
        - appsettings.json
        - AspireApp.Web.csproj
        - Program.cs
        - WeatherApiClient.cs
    </FileTree>

    This solution structure is based on the Aspire templates. If they're not installed already, the CLI will install them for you.

1. Change to the _output_ directory:

    ```bash title="Change directoriesâ€”stepping into the output directory"
    cd ./AspireApp
    ```

1. Run the Aspire app host project:

    ```bash title="Run dev-time orchestration"
    aspire run
    ```

    When you run this command, the Aspire CLI automatically finds the app host project, builds your solution, and launches dev-time orchestration. Once the dashboard is ready, its URL (with a login token) appears in your console. You'll also see a live, real-time view of your running resources and their current states.

    ```bash title="Example output of aspire run"
    aspire run

    Dashboard:
    ðŸ“ˆ  https://localhost:17076/login?t=<Your session's access token>

    Press Ctrl+C to stop the app host and exit.
    ```

1. Explore the running distributed application. From the dashboard, open the `HTTPS` endpoint from each resource.

    ![Aspire dashboard Resources page displaying two running resources: apiservice and webfrontend. Both are marked as Running with green check icons. The table lists columns for Name, State, Start time, Source, URLs, and Actions. apiservice uses AspireApp.ApiService.csproj and has URLs https://localhost:7393 and webfrontend uses AspireApp.Web.csproj with URL https://localhost:7214. The interface has a dark theme with navigation options for Resources, Console, Structured, Traces, and Metrics on the left.](../../../assets/get-started/aspire-dashboard.png)

1. Stop the app host and close the dashboard by pressing <Kbd windows="Ctrl+C" mac="âŒ˜+C" />.

    **Congratulations! You've created your first Aspire app.**

</Steps>

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic understanding of how to create and run an Aspire app, give it a try in a GitHub Codespace. This will allow you to quickly set up a development environment without needing to install anything locally:
