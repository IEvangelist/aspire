Aspire includes tooling to help you create and configure cloud-native apps. The tooling includes useful starter project templates and other features to streamline getting started with Aspire for Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and CLI workflows. Assuming you have the [prerequisites](./prerequisites) installed, you can install the Aspire CLI and create a new project.

<Steps>

1. Install the Aspire CLI:

    ```console
    dotnet tool install --global aspire.cli --prerelease
    ```

    <Aside type='note'>
      The Aspire CLI is currently in preview, thus the `--prerelease` flag is used.
    </Aside>

1. Verify the installation by calling the CLI help command:

    ```console
    aspire --help
    ```

    You should see an example usage format, with a list of available options and commands, similar to the following:

    ```console frame="none"
    Description:
    The Aspire CLI can be used to create, run, and publish Aspire-based applications.

    --wait-for-debugger  Wait for a debugger to attach before executing the command. [default: False]
