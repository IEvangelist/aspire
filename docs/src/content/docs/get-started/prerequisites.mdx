To get started with Aspire, you need to install a few prerequisites. This guide will help you set up your development environment for building and running Aspire applications.

## Install the required SDK

Install either [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or [.NET 9.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) to work with Aspire. No prior .NET experience is required.

### Install OCI compliant container runtime

Aspire uses an OCI compliant container runtime to run and manage containers. The most common option is Docker Desktop, which provides a user-friendly interface for managing containers and images.

  Docker Desktop
</LinkButton>

Alternatively, you can use [Podman](https://podman.io/), which is a daemonless container engine that can run containers without requiring root privileges.

### Install desired IDE

Aspire supports multiple IDEs and code editors. You can choose the one that best fits your workflow:

<IconAside type='tip' icon='vscode' title='Visual Studio Code Tip'>
  When choosing Visual Studio Code, it's recommended to install the [C# DevKit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) for .NET developmet. This extension provides features like IntelliSense, debugging, and project managemen

### Alternatives to local installation

If you prefer not to install the prerequisites locally, you can develop Aspire solutions using either:

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="GitHub Codespaces"
    href="../get-started/github-codespaces.md" />
  <LinkCard
    title="Dev Containers"
    href="../get-started/dev-containers.md" />
</CardGrid>


<Aside type='note'>
  These options allow you to work in a cloud-based environment, eliminating the need for local installations. But they may not provide the same performance as local installations.
