Aspire makes it easy to define everything your app needs—frontends, APIs, databases, and more—using the unified **AppHost** model. Just describe your resources in code, and Aspire handles the connections for you.

## Types of Resources

Resources can include:

- **AI Services**: Large Language Models, AI endpoints, and cognitive services.
- **Caches**: Redis, in-memory caches, and distributed caching solutions.
- **Containers**: Docker containers for databases, message brokers, and other services.
- **Databases**: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and other data stores.
- **Executables**: Console applications, scripts, and background services.
- **Frameworks**: Web applications, APIs, and microservices built with various frameworks.
- **Messaging Services**: Service Bus, RabbitMQ, Kafka, and other messaging systems.
- **Projects**: .NET projects, Node.js applications, Python services, and more.
- **Storage**: Blob storage, file systems, and cloud storage services.

## Resource Dependencies

One resource can depend on another, and Aspire automatically wires them together. This means you can focus on building your app without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

For example, if your API service depends on a database, Aspire will:

<Steps>
1. Start the database first.
1. Wait for it to become healthy.
1. Inject the connection string into your API service.
1. Start your API service.
</Steps>

## Resource Configuration

Resources can be configured in various ways:

- **Environment Variables**: Set configuration through environment variables.
- **Connection Strings**: Automatically generated and injected for dependent services.
- **Resource Parameters**: Configure ports, volumes, and other resource-specific settings.
- **Health Checks**: Define custom health check endpoints for your services.

## Custom Resources

Under-the-hood, every integration is either a **Container** or **Executable**, meaning you can add _any_ container image, codebase, script, or cloud resource to your AppHost.

<Aside type="note">
  Creating reusable Aspire integrations is just like creating a reusable UI component. It can be as simple or complex as you need, and is fully shareable. Learn more about creating custom resources for Aspire.

## Resource Lifecycle

Aspire manages the complete lifecycle of your resources:

<Steps>
1. **Provisioning**: Resources are created and configured according to your specifications.
1. **Starting**: Resources are started in dependency order.
1. **Monitoring**: Health and status are continuously monitored.
1. **Scaling**: Resources can be scaled up or down as needed.
1. **Cleanup**: Resources are properly disposed of when the application shuts down.
</Steps>
