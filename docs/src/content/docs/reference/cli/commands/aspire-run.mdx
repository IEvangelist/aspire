## Synopsis

The command performs the following steps to run an Aspire AppHost:

- Creates or modifies the `.aspire/settings.json` config file in the current directory, and sets the `appHostPath` config value to the path of the AppHost project file.
- Installs or verifies that Aspire's local hosting certificates are installed and trusted.
- Builds the AppHost project and its resources.
- Starts the AppHost and its resources.
- Starts the dashboard.

The following snippet is an example of the output displayed by the `aspire run` command:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
Dashboard:  https://localhost:17178/login?t=17f974bf68e390b0d4548af8d7e38b65
