## Why developers love Aspire

<FluidGrid>
  <SimpleCard title="Code-centric Control" icon="laptop">
    Define your stack in code—type-safe, readable, and debuggable. Aspire launches locally, then shifts to real cloud services without changing your architecture. Dev to deploy, fully wired.
  </SimpleCard>
  <SimpleCard title="Modular and Extensible" icon="puzzle">
    Orchestrate your frontends, APIs, containers, and databases—no rewrites. Extend Aspire for anything. Build with what you know and deploy anywhere: local, hybrid, cloud, edge, or on-prem.
  </SimpleCard>
  <SimpleCard title="Observability from the Start" icon="magnifier">
    Built-in OpenTelemetry gives you zero-config observability from day one—logs, traces, and health checks streaming—so you get instant insights and faster debugging with no setup required.
  </SimpleCard>
  <SimpleCard title="Flexible Deployments" icon="rocket">
    Launch on your terms—Kubernetes, your own infrastructure, or managed cloud. Aspire snaps to your environment, not vice versa, delivering flexible repeatable deployments without rewrites.
  </SimpleCard>
</FluidGrid>

## Code-centric control

Aspire is modular, composable, and extensible. Configure relationships, deployment options, and dev-time flags in one place.

## Polyglot, multi-language support

**Works with your existing stack** — Aspire orchestrates applications written in C#, Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, PHP, Ruby, and more. Your team can keep using the languages and frameworks you know.

import LanguagesSupported from '../../components/LanguagesSupported.astro';

<LanguagesSupported />

Aspire supports a wide range of languages and frameworks, allowing you to build applications in the languages you love while benefiting from Aspire's orchestration capabilities.

<Card title="Language Flexibility" icon="seti:json">
  **Frontend**: React, Vue, Angular, Blazor, Next.js, and more  
  **Backend**: C#, Node.js, Python (FastAPI/Django), Go, PHP (Laravel/Symfony), Ruby on Rails, Java (Spring Boot)  
  **Any Container**: Docker containers work seamlessly with Aspire orchestration
</Card>

## Local-first, Production-ready

**Aspire is designed to be local-first**, meaning you develop and test your applications on your local machine and Aspire strives to closely mirror production. This approach reduces the "works on my machine" problem and ensures a smoother transition to production.

## Same model—different environments

Use Aspire's CLI to spin everything up locally or create deployment artifacts during your CI/CD.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Local Development" icon="laptop">

  <Code code={'aspire run'} lang='bash' frame='none' />

  - Runs with your local container runtime
  - Dashboard available on `localhost`
  - Uses dev secrets, volumes, dev-time config
  
  <LinkCard href="/aspire/get-started/installation"
            title='Aspire CLI — run'
            description='Run your entire stack locally—instantly orchestrated for development.' />

  </Card>

  <Card title="Production Deployment" icon="rocket">

  <Code code={'aspire publish'} lang='bash' frame='none' />

  - Same app structure, deployed where you want
  - Use managed cloud services or your own infra
  - Integrates with CI/CD pipelines seamlessly

  <LinkCard href="/aspire/get-started/installation"
            title='Aspire CLI — publish'
            description='Model your app once—deploy anywhere, from cloud to on-prem.' />
