## Why developers love Aspire

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Code-centric Control" icon="laptop">
    Define your stack in codeâ€”no YAML. Aspire launches locally, then shifts to real cloud services without changing your architecture. Dev and deploy, fully wired.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modular and Extensible" icon="puzzle">
    Orchestrate your existing stackâ€”frontends, APIs, containers, databases, and more â€” without rewriting or replatforming. Extend Aspire for anything.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Observability from the Start" icon="magnifier">
    Logs, traces, health checksâ€”all local, all wired up automatically. OpenTelemetry included with zero setup.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexible Deployments" icon="rocket">
    Ship it how you **want** â€” to Kubernetes, your own infra, or managed services. Aspire adapts to your environment, not the other way around.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Code-centric control

import ThreeTierAspire from '../../components/ThreeTierAspire.astro';

<ThreeTierAspire />

## Same modelâ€”different environments

**Model your stack in C#â€”not YAML**, fully type-safeâ€”for seamless development, staging, and production deployments.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Local Development" icon="laptop">

  <Code code={'aspire run'} lang='bash' frame='none' />

  - Runs with your local container runtime
  - Dashboard available on `localhost`
  - Uses dev secrets, volumes, dev-time config
  
  <LinkCard href="/aspire/get-started/installation"
            title='Aspire CLI â€” run'
            description='Run your entire stack locallyâ€”instantly orchestrated for development.' />

  </Card>

  <Card title="Production Deployment" icon="rocket">

  <Code code={'aspire publish'} lang='bash' frame='none' />

  - Same app structure, deployed where you want
  - Use managed cloud services or your own infra
  - Works with your pipeline, no code changes required

  <LinkCard href="/aspire/get-started/installation"
            title='Aspire CLI â€” deploy'
            description='Model your app onceâ€”deploy anywhere, from cloud to on-prem.' />

## Local-first, Production-ready

**Aspire is designed to be local-first**, meaning you develop and test your applications on your local machine and Aspire strives to closely mirror production. This approach reduces the "works on my machine" problem and ensures a smoother transition to production.

import LocalVsProdEnvironments from '../../components/LocalVsProdEnvironments.astro';

## Works with your existing CI/CD

**Aspire enhances your pipeline** â€” it doesn't replace your security scans, linting, or testing. Integrate Aspire deployment into GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, or any CI/CD system.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="What Aspire Adds" icon="approve-check">
    - **Orchestration**: Manages service connections and configuration
    - **Local Development**: Consistent dev environment for your team
    - **Deployment**: Publishes to your target infrastructure
  </Card>
  <Card title="What You Keep" icon="seti:lock">
    - **Security Scanning**: SAST, dependency checks, vulnerability scans
    - **Quality Gates**: Unit tests, integration tests, code coverage
    - **Approval Processes**: Manual approvals, staging validations
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## OpenTelemetry developer dashboard

**Monitor logs, metrics, and traces in real time with the built-in OpenTelemetry dashboard**â€”insightful, visual, and ready out of the box.
