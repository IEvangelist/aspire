## Why developers love Aspire

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Code-centric Control" icon="laptop">
    Define your stack in code â€” type-safe, readable, and debuggable. Aspire launches locally, then shifts to real cloud services without changing your architecture. Dev to deploy, fully wired.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modular and Extensible" icon="puzzle">
    Orchestrate your existing stack â€” frontends, APIs, containers, databases, and more â€” without rewriting or replatforming. Extend Aspire for anything.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Observability from the Start" icon="magnifier">
    Logs, traces, health checksâ€”all local, all wired up automatically. OpenTelemetry included with zero setup.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexible Deployments" icon="rocket">
    Ship it how you **want** â€” to Kubernetes, your own infra, or managed services. Aspire adapts to your environment, not the other way around.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Code-centric control

Aspire is modular, composable, and extensible. Configure relationships, deployment options, and dev-time flags in one place.

import AppHostBuilder from '../../components/AppHostBuilder.astro';

## Local-first, Production-ready

**Aspire is designed to be local-first**, meaning you develop and test your applications on your local machine and Aspire strives to closely mirror production. This approach reduces the "works on my machine" problem and ensures a smoother transition to production.

import LocalVsProdEnvironments from '../../components/LocalVsProdEnvironments.astro';

## Same modelâ€”different environments

Use Aspire's CLI to spin everything up locally or create deployment artifacts during your CI/CD.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Local Development" icon="laptop">

  <Code code={'aspire run'} lang='bash' frame='none' />

  - Runs with your local container runtime
  - Dashboard available on `localhost`
  - Uses dev secrets, volumes, dev-time config
  
  <LinkCard href="/aspire/get-started/installation"
            title='Aspire CLI â€” run'
            description='Run your entire stack locallyâ€”instantly orchestrated for development.' />

  </Card>

  <Card title="Production Deployment" icon="rocket">

  <Code code={'aspire publish'} lang='bash' frame='none' />

  - Same app structure, deployed where you want
  - Use managed cloud services or your own infra
  - Works as part of your pipeline, no code changes required

  <LinkCard href="/aspire/get-started/installation"
            title='Aspire CLI â€” publish'
            description='Model your app onceâ€”deploy anywhere, from cloud to on-prem.' />

  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## OpenTelemetry developer dashboard

**Monitor logs, metrics, and traces in real time with the built-in OpenTelemetry dashboard**â€”insightful, visual, and ready out of the box.
