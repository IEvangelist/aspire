title: Dashboard Overview
---

Aspire templates include a sophisticated dashboard for comprehensive app monitoring and inspection. The dashboard is also available in [standalone mode](#standalone-mode). The dashboard enables real-time tracking of key aspects of your app, including logs, traces, and environment configurations. It's designed to enhance the development experience by providing a clear and insightful view of your app's state and structure.

Key features of the dashboard include:

- Real-time tracking of logs, traces, and environment configurations.
- User interface to stop, start, and restart resources.
- Collects and displays logs and telemetry; view structured logs, traces, and metrics in an intuitive UI.
- Enhanced debugging with GitHub Copilot, your AI-powered assistant built into the dashboard.

## Use the dashboard with Aspire projects

The dashboard is integrated into the AppHost. During development the dashboard is automatically launched when you start the project. It's configured to display the Aspire project's resources and telemetry.

The table lists columns for Name, State, Start time, Source, URLs, and Actions. apiservice uses AspireApp.ApiService.csproj and has URLs https://localhost:7393 and webfrontend uses AspireApp.Web.csproj with URL https://localhost:7214. The interface has a dark theme with navigation options for Resources, Console, Structured, Traces, and Metrics on the left.](../../../assets/get-started/aspire-dashboard.png)

## Standalone mode

The Aspire dashboard is also shipped as a Docker image and can be used standalone, without the rest of Aspire. The standalone dashboard provides a great UI for viewing telemetry and can be used by any application.

import { Code, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
      <Code title="Bash â€” Run Aspire from Docker" code={`docker run --rm -it -p 18888:18888 -p 4317:18889 -d --name aspire-dashboard \\
    mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:9.0`} lang="bash" frame="terminal" />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
      <Code title="PowerShell â€” Run Aspire from Docker" code={`docker run --rm -it -p 18888:18888 -p 4317:18889 -d --name aspire-dashboard \`
    mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:9.0`} lang="powershell" frame="terminal" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The preceding Docker command:

- Starts a container from the `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:9.0` image.
- The container instance exposing two ports:
  - Maps the dashboard's OTLP port `18889` to the host's port `4317`. Port `4317` receives OpenTelemetry data from apps. Apps send data using [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/).
  - Maps the dashboard's port `18888` to the host's port `18888`. Port `18888` has the dashboard UI. Navigate to `http://localhost:18888` in the browser to view the dashboard.

## Configuration

The dashboard is configured when it starts up. Configuration includes frontend and OTLP addresses, the resource service endpoint, authentication, telemetry limits and more.

## Architecture

The dashboard user experience is built with a variety of technologies. The frontend is built with [ðŸ“¦ Grpc.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.AspNetCore) NuGet package to the resource server. Consider the following diagram that illustrates the architecture of the Aspire dashboard:

import ArchitectureDiagram from './architecture-diagram.svg';

<ArchitectureDiagram style="border-radius: .5rem; box-shadow: var(--sl-shadow-sm)" />

## Security

The Aspire dashboard offers powerful insights to your apps. The UI displays information about resources, including their configuration, console logs and in-depth telemetry.

Data displayed in the dashboard can be sensitive. For example, configuration can include secrets in environment variables, and telemetry can include sensitive runtime data. Care should be taken to secure access to the dashboard.
